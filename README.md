## Contributing
You are free to submit pull requests. If you want to contribute more than just by pull requests, send me message and we can work something out.

If you submit pull request, make sure all unit tests pass. Similary, if you add a new feature, write tests for it. I'm aiming for high unit test coverage (>90%), so please try and do the same.

Add comments to your code. Comment public methods and members and non self-explanatory private methods and members.

## Issues
If you come across issue, you can report it here on github. Please provide clear and concise description of the problem. "I ran it and it crashed" is not a good bug report.
